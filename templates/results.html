					<p>Education is one of the most important factors in determining an individual’s earning power. Individuals with higher levels of education tend to earn more, as seen in Chart 1, where people with Advanced Degrees earn the most. This should be good news for women, as they earned over 800,000 more degrees than men did in 2013; yet for each level of education, women earn less.</p>
					<p>One possible explanation is that women focus on majors that have lower earnings powers, such as education and the arts, than the majors chosen by men, such as computer science and engineering.</p>
					<p>To identify differences in education outcomes for men and women, IPEDS data is used to calculate the most common degree groups. Perhaps surprisingly, the three most common degree families for both men and women are Business, Healthcare and Liberal arts.</p>

				<p>Yet the common perception of ‘typical’ majors for each gender likely still plays a part in earnings potential. The fourth and fifth most common degrees for men are in computer science and engineering, while education is fourth for women and the visual arts comes in at number eight. Table 1 shows how these ‘typical’ male majors relate to occupations that earn over $400 more every week than the ‘typical’ female majors.</p>

				 	<p>Therefore it is necessary to turn to the CPS data to review differences in earnings by different occupations, as well as within the same occupations between men and women.</p>
					<p>Chart 2 shows a variety of different occupations, starting with the five highest earning occupations and ending with the five lowest earning occupations. Amongst the five highest earning occupations, only Pharmacists have an equal number of men and women; the remaining four are heavily male dominated. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the five lowest earning occupations tend to have more women than men, except for cooks. This lack of women in the highest earning fields, and high representation in low earning fields, likely accounts for at least part of the observed lower median earnings for women at the national level.</p>

				<p>In examining Chart 2, it is also striking that the lowest paid occupations are also the most equal in pay across gender. Women who are Cooks or in either Food Preparation occupation, earn over 93 cents on the dollar that men earn in these occupations. However this is from a very low base where earnings cannot go much lower. Meanwhile women who are Chief Executives or Physicians earn only 80 cents on the dollar that men earn. This suggests there is great variability in pay at the top of the spectrum, perhaps caused by further specialization within these occupations that is not possible in the lowest earning occupations.</p>
				<p>Finally the other six fields in this Chart show the three largest employers each for men and women, based on the number of men or women employed in that occupation. The largest employer of men is “Other Managers”, an occupation that earns $1,408 a week overall, whereas the largest employer of women “Registered Nurses” earns $1,116 overall, a difference of almost $300 a week. However, in comparing the earnings of female nurses versus male managers, the difference opens up to almost $600 a week.</p>
				<p>Therefore while the nation-wide wage gap between men and women is 81 cents on the dollar, there appears to be some occupational sorting that helps to explain some of the difference. However, even within individual occupations there appears to be a wide range in the wage gap between men and women.</p>
